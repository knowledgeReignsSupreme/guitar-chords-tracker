## What is the purpose of this project?

If you are learning to play the guitar, there is a great practice method called "1 minute chord changes" in which you pick a couple of chords you want to practice and try to change between those two chords as much times as you can within that minute. <br />
In this project, you can set a 1minute timer and start changing between the selected chords! <br />
Once the timer is finished, type the amount of times you managed to change between the chords. <br />
If this is your first time practicing this set of chords, it will be shown in the records list below. <br />
If you already practiced those chords but didn't break you last record, no worries, you can always try again! <br />
But if you broke your former record, the new record will be shown in the list below <br />
The data is saved on your browser storage so you can always come back and challenge yourself! <br />
